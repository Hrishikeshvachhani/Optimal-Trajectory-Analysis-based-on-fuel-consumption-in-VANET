# Optimal-Trajectory-Analysis-based-on-fuel-consumption-in-VANET
In this project we are going to develop a system which will be able to analyse the vehicle density at certain cluster points and ultimately visualize the fuel consumption at those points. This will help to understand the fuel consumption by the vehicles at different points and that at different period of time. So using this data we can predict the vehicle density at given period of time and thus its fuel consumption at that time. These predictions can thus help us to assist the user in selecting a better path, such that the fuel consumption can be minimized. These can be achieved at individual user level, as well as at higher level for an area of city or even a whole city, as the data can be quite varied. This makes it suitable to be used for both, individual user to minimize fuel consumption, or for a city to minimize its overall fuel consumption. To make this work we used time series based algorithm LSTM to predict the density of the vehicles at a given time period.
